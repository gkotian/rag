About:
------
The Random Address Generator can be used to generate random MAC, IPv4 & IPv6 addresses.

Compiling:
----------
make clean
make

This should produce an executable file called 'rag'.
Either double-click this file, or run it from the command line.

Enhancements needed:
--------------------
    -> Increase font, different colours for different type of address (refer gtk_label_set_markup)
    -> Proper validation of IPv4 & IPv6 addresses
    -> Add function headers
    -> Display status in the status bar
    -> Move to cmake
